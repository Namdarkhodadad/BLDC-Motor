# BLDC-Motor

This project, in which I worked with my then colleague Parsa Mashayekhi and supervisor Amin Samimi (Rooydad), demonstrates the required steps of building an efficient brushless/sensorless motor from scratch. However due to copyright regulations set by my supervisor, I'm not allowed to share the final STM32 codes, and the final Altium PCB design(including footprints and schematics). I have simply explained every step and problem we faced, and provided the code for another microcontroller, which could be transfered to an STM32 easily.
Please read the file named "Unofficial_Report.pdf" for the explanations, and check out my "ATmega8a_Final.c" code file. Read the comments to understand the code better. 
For any further questions please email me: nommykhodadad1380@gmail.com
I will be more than glad to provide you with more detailed codes and charts if requested.
The final PCB and motor images are in the "Final_Outcome" folder.
This project was a HUGE success and is ready for mass production.
